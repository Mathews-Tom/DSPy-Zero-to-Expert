            # üìù Exercise 03: Advanced RAG Patterns

            **Objective:** Implement sophisticated RAG patterns for complex reasoning and information synthesis.

            ## üéØ Your Mission

            Build an advanced RAG system that demonstrates:  
            1. Multi-hop reasoning across multiple documents  
            2. Query decomposition and planning  
            3. Adaptive strategy selection based on query type  
            4. Advanced result fusion and ranking  

            ## üìã Requirements

            **Part A: Multi-Hop RAG System**  
            - Implement a system that can chain multiple retrieval-generation cycles  
            - Break down complex questions into sub-questions  
            - Maintain context across multiple reasoning steps  
            - Synthesize information from multiple sources  

            **Part B: Query Analysis and Planning**  
            - Build a query classifier that identifies question types  
            - Implement query decomposition for complex questions  
            - Create execution plans with dependency tracking  
            - Handle different reasoning patterns (factual, analytical, comparative)  

            **Part C: Adaptive RAG Strategy**  
            - Design multiple RAG strategies for different query types  
            - Implement automatic strategy selection based on query analysis  
            - Add fallback mechanisms for failed strategies  
            - Track strategy performance and adapt over time  

            **Part D: Advanced Result Processing**  
            - Implement result fusion from multiple retrieval strategies  
            - Add sophisticated re-ranking based on multiple criteria  
            - Include confidence scoring and uncertainty handling  
            - Create comprehensive answer synthesis  

            ## üöÄ Bonus Challenges

            1. **Hierarchical Reasoning:** Implement hierarchical document organization and retrieval  
            2. **Temporal Reasoning:** Handle time-sensitive queries and document freshness  
            3. **Multi-Modal RAG:** Extend to handle different content types (text, tables, etc.)  
            4. **Conversational RAG:** Maintain conversation context across multiple turns  
            5. **Explainable RAG:** Provide detailed explanations of reasoning steps  

            ## üí° Hints

            - Start with simple multi-hop scenarios before tackling complex reasoning  
            - Use clear state management to track reasoning progress  
            - Design modular components that can be easily combined  
            - Focus on robust error handling and graceful degradation  
            - Consider computational efficiency in your design

                **Next Steps:**
                - Compare your implementation with the solution
                - Consider real-world deployment challenges
                - Think about how to evaluate these advanced patterns
                - Explore integration with the evaluation framework from the next exercise
