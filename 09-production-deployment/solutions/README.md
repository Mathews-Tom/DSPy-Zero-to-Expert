## üöÄ Running the Exercises

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have all required dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install asyncio psutil aiohttp pyyaml schedule
```

### Running Individual Exercises

Each exercise can be run independently:

```bash
# Exercise 1: Production Deployment Setup
python solutions/exercise_01_deployment_setup.py

# Exercise 2: Scaling and Cost Optimization
python solutions/exercise_02_scaling_optimization.py

# Exercise 3: Maintenance Automation and Self-Healing
python solutions/exercise_03_maintenance_automation.py

# Exercise 4: Comprehensive Production Deployment
python solutions/exercise_04_comprehensive_deployment.py
```

### Running All Exercises

To run all exercises in sequence:

```bash
python -c "
import asyncio
import sys
sys.path.append('solutions')

from exercise_01_deployment_setup import exercise_01_solution
from exercise_02_scaling_optimization import exercise_02_solution
from exercise_03_maintenance_automation import exercise_03_solution
from exercise_04_comprehensive_deployment import exercise_04_solution

async def run_all():
    print('Running all exercises...')
    await exercise_01_solution()
    await exercise_02_solution()
    await exercise_03_maintenance_automation()
    await exercise_04_solution()
    print('All exercises completed!')

asyncio.run(run_all())
"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   - Ensure you're running from the correct directory
   - Check that all parent modules are in the Python path
   - Install missing dependencies

2. **Port Conflicts**
   - Default ports: 8080 (dashboard), 9090 (Prometheus)
   - Modify port configurations if conflicts occur

3. **Permission Issues**
   - Ensure write permissions for backup and log directories
   - Check file system permissions for configuration files

4. **Resource Constraints**
   - Exercises simulate resource usage
   - Adjust simulation parameters for lower-spec systems

### Debug Mode

To run exercises with debug output:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="..:$PYTHONPATH"
python -u solutions/exercise_01_deployment_setup.py 2>&1 | tee exercise_01.log
```
