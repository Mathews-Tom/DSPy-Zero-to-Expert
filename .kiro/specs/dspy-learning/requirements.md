# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves creating a comprehensive interactive learning repository called "DSPy Zero-to-Expert" that teaches DSPy (a framework for programming with language models) through progressive, hands-on lessons using Marimo notebooks. The repository will serve expert Python developers with GenAI and agentic system experience, providing them with practical skills to build sophisticated AI applications using DSPy's optimization and evaluation techniques.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Python developer with GenAI experience, I want a structured learning path through DSPy concepts, so that I can systematically master all core components and build production-ready agentic applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the repository THEN the system SHALL provide a clear 10-module progressive learning structure
2. WHEN a user completes a module THEN the system SHALL ensure they have mastered the prerequisite concepts for the next module
3. WHEN a user follows the learning path THEN the system SHALL guide them from basic DSPy signatures to advanced multi-agent systems
4. IF a user has intermediate experience THEN the system SHALL provide alternative entry points to skip basic modules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want interactive Marimo notebooks for each module, so that I can experiment with DSPy concepts in real-time and see immediate results from parameter changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a module THEN the system SHALL provide interactive Marimo notebooks with reactive UI elements
2. WHEN a user modifies parameters in the notebook THEN the system SHALL immediately update results and visualizations
3. WHEN a user experiments with DSPy signatures THEN the system SHALL provide interactive testing interfaces with sliders and input fields
4. WHEN a user works through exercises THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback through interactive components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer learning DSPy, I want hands-on practical exercises in each module, so that I can apply concepts immediately and build real working examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a module THEN the system SHALL provide practical exercises that reinforce the learned concepts
2. WHEN a user works on exercises THEN the system SHALL provide solution examples for reference
3. WHEN a user builds DSPy applications THEN the system SHALL guide them through complete implementations from setup to evaluation
4. WHEN a user progresses through modules THEN the system SHALL ensure exercises build incrementally in complexity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured development environment with modern Python tooling, so that I can focus on learning DSPy without setup friction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets up the project THEN the system SHALL use uv package manager for fast dependency management
2. WHEN a user installs dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide a complete pyproject.toml with all required packages
3. WHEN a user configures the environment THEN the system SHALL support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere)
4. WHEN a user runs the setup THEN the system SHALL verify installation with test scripts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a learner, I want comprehensive coverage of DSPy optimization and evaluation techniques, so that I can build high-performance AI systems with proper metrics and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user learns optimization THEN the system SHALL cover BootstrapFewShot and MIPRO teleprompters
2. WHEN a user implements evaluation THEN the system SHALL provide custom metrics creation and visualization tools
3. WHEN a user optimizes DSPy systems THEN the system SHALL provide interactive dashboards to track progress
4. WHEN a user evaluates performance THEN the system SHALL include A/B testing frameworks and benchmarking tools

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to learn advanced DSPy patterns including RAG, multi-step reasoning, and tool integration, so that I can build sophisticated agentic systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user learns RAG THEN the system SHALL provide complete implementations with vector databases and retrieval optimization
2. WHEN a user implements ReAct agents THEN the system SHALL include tool integration with external APIs
3. WHEN a user builds multi-step reasoning THEN the system SHALL provide debugging interfaces and tracing capabilities
4. WHEN a user creates agentic systems THEN the system SHALL cover multi-agent workflows and complex reasoning patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer preparing for production, I want guidance on deployment, scaling, and monitoring of DSPy applications, so that I can successfully deploy my AI systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user prepares for deployment THEN the system SHALL provide containerization and deployment guides
2. WHEN a user scales applications THEN the system SHALL include monitoring and alerting setup instructions
3. WHEN a user maintains systems THEN the system SHALL provide maintenance dashboards and update workflows
4. WHEN a user optimizes performance THEN the system SHALL include scaling strategies and performance optimization techniques

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a learner, I want reusable components and utilities, so that I can efficiently build upon previous work and focus on new concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user works across modules THEN the system SHALL provide a common utilities library with reusable components
2. WHEN a user creates Marimo interfaces THEN the system SHALL offer pre-built UI components for DSPy interactions
3. WHEN a user implements evaluations THEN the system SHALL provide shared evaluation utilities and metrics
4. WHEN a user extends functionality THEN the system SHALL include DSPy extensions and custom module templates

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and troubleshooting resources, so that I can resolve issues independently and understand best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user encounters issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed troubleshooting documentation
2. WHEN a user needs reference material THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive API documentation
3. WHEN a user follows best practices THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidelines for DSPy and Marimo integration
4. WHEN a user explores advanced topics THEN the system SHALL offer additional resources and case studies

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a learner, I want a capstone project module with real-world applications, so that I can demonstrate mastery by building complete AI-powered solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
