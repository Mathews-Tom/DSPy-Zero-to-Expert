        # üèóÔ∏è Module 01: DSPy Foundations - Signatures & Basic Modules

        Welcome to the core of DSPy! In this module, you'll master the fundamental building blocks of DSPy programming.

        ## üéØ Learning Objectives

        By the end of this module, you'll be able to:  
        - Design sophisticated DSPy signatures with best practices  
        - Understand inline vs class-based signature patterns  
        - Use different DSPy modules (Predict, ChainOfThought, etc.)  
        - Compose signatures for complex tasks  
        - Test and validate signatures systematically  

        ## üìö What We'll Cover

        1. **Signature Design Patterns** - Advanced techniques for effective signatures
        2. **Module Types** - When to use Predict vs ChainOfThought vs others
        3. **Signature Composition** - Building complex tasks from simple parts
        4. **Interactive Testing** - Systematic validation and debugging
        5. **Best Practices** - Professional DSPy development patterns

                            **Key Observations:**
                            - Both modules can include reasoning in their responses
                            - ChainOfThought is designed to separate reasoning from final answers
                            - The actual behavior may vary based on the LLM and prompt structure
                            - In practice, test both approaches to see which works better for your use case

                            **Expected Differences:**
                            - **Predict**: Usually more direct, faster execution
                            - **ChainOfThought**: Designed for explicit reasoning steps, may be more reliable for complex problems

        **Next Module: Advanced DSPy Modules**  
        ```bash
        uv run marimo run 02-advanced-modules/react_implementation.py
        ```

        **Topics Coming Up:**  
        - ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) modules  
        - Tool integration and external APIs  
        - Multi-step reasoning pipelines

        ### üí° Practice Suggestions

        Before moving on, try creating signatures for:  
        - Email classification (spam/not spam)  
        - Code review and suggestions  
        - Recipe generation from ingredients  
        - Meeting notes summarization  

        The more you practice, the more intuitive signature design becomes!
