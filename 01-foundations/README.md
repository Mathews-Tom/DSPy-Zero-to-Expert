# Module 01: DSPy Foundations - Signatures & Basic Modules

**Duration:** 60-75 minutes  
**Description:** Learn DSPy's core programming model through Signatures and basic modules, with hands-on Marimo interactions

## Learning Goals

- Master DSPy Signature creation and usage
- Understand the difference between inline and class-based signatures
- Work with dspy.Predict and dspy.ChainOfThought modules
- Build interactive signature testing with Marimo UI elements

## Key Concepts

- DSPy Signatures
- Module architecture
- Predict modules
- ChainOfThought reasoning
- Interactive parameter tuning

## Files in this Module
