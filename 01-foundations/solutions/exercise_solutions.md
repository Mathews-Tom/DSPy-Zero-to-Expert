# üìö Module 01 Exercise Solutions

This document provides reference solutions and detailed explanations for all Module 01 exercises.

## üéØ Exercise 1: Signature Design Fundamentals

### Challenge 1: Basic Classification Signature

**Reference Solution:**

```python
class TicketClassifier(dspy.Signature):
    """Classify customer support tickets into appropriate categories with confidence assessment."""
    message = dspy.InputField(desc="Customer support message or inquiry text")
    categories = dspy.InputField(desc="Available categories: technical, billing, general, complaint")
    category = dspy.OutputField(desc="Selected category from: technical, billing, general, complaint")
    confidence = dspy.OutputField(desc="Confidence score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating certainty")
```

**Key Design Elements:**

- **Clear docstring** explaining the classification task
- **Descriptive field names** that indicate purpose
- **Specific constraints** in field descriptions (category options, confidence range)
- **Appropriate field count** for the task complexity

**Common Mistakes:**

- Vague field descriptions like "input text" instead of "customer support message"
- Missing confidence score output
- Not specifying valid category options
- Overly brief docstring

### Challenge 2: Multi-Output Analysis Signature

**Reference Solution:**

```python
class ReviewAnalyzer(dspy.Signature):
    """Analyze product reviews to extract sentiment, features, rating, and key insights."""
    review_text = dspy.InputField(desc="Product review text to analyze for sentiment and content")
    product_category = dspy.InputField(desc="Product category (electronics, clothing, books, etc.)")
    sentiment = dspy.OutputField(desc="Overall sentiment: positive, negative, or neutral")
    key_features = dspy.OutputField(desc="3-5 key product features mentioned in the review")
    rating_prediction = dspy.OutputField(desc="Predicted star rating from 1-5 based on review content")
    summary = dspy.OutputField(desc="Brief 1-2 sentence summary of main review points")
```

**Advanced Features:**

- **Multiple structured outputs** providing comprehensive analysis
- **Context input** (product category) for better accuracy
- **Format specifications** (3-5 features, 1-5 rating, 1-2 sentences)
- **Business-relevant outputs** that provide actionable insights

### Challenge 3: Complex Reasoning Signature

**Reference Solution:**

```python
class MathProblemSolver(dspy.Signature):
    """Solve mathematical word problems with step-by-step reasoning and verification."""
    problem_text = dspy.InputField(desc="Mathematical word problem to solve")
    difficulty_level = dspy.InputField(desc="Problem difficulty: easy, medium, or hard")
    solution_steps = dspy.OutputField(desc="Step-by-step solution process with clear reasoning")
    final_answer = dspy.OutputField(desc="Final numerical answer with appropriate units")
    verification = dspy.OutputField(desc="Verification by checking the answer or using alternative method")
    confidence = dspy.OutputField(desc="Confidence in solution correctness from 0.0 to 1.0")
```

**Reasoning-Optimized Design:**

    language = dspy.InputField(desc="Programming language (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)")
    review_focus = dspy.InputField(desc="Review focus: security, performance, style, or general")
    quality_score = dspy.OutputField(desc="Code quality score from 1-10 with brief justification")
    issues_found = dspy.OutputField(desc="List of specific issues, bugs, or security concerns")
    improvement_suggestions = dspy.OutputField(desc="Concrete suggestions for code improvement")
    best_practices = dspy.OutputField(desc="Relevant best practices and coding standards")
```

**Example 2: Meeting Minutes Generator**

```python
class MeetingMinutesGenerator(dspy.Signature):
    """Generate structured meeting minutes with action items and decisions from meeting notes."""
    meeting_notes = dspy.InputField(desc="Raw meeting notes or transcript")
    participants = dspy.InputField(desc="List of meeting participants and their roles")
    meeting_type = dspy.InputField(desc="Meeting type: planning, review, decision, brainstorm")
    summary = dspy.OutputField(desc="Concise meeting summary highlighting key discussions")
    decisions_made = dspy.OutputField(desc="Important decisions made during the meeting")
    action_items = dspy.OutputField(desc="Action items with owners and deadlines if mentioned")
    next_steps = dspy.OutputField(desc="Planned next steps and follow-up actions")
