#### **MIPRO (Multi-stage Instruction Prompt Optimization)**

- **Purpose**: Optimize instructions and prompts in separate, focused stages
- **Best For**: Complex reasoning tasks and creative generation
- **Stages**: Instruction optimization ‚Üí Prompt optimization ‚Üí Combined refinement

#### **Custom Metrics**

- **Purpose**: Create evaluation functions that match your specific success criteria
- **Types**: Exact match, fuzzy matching, semantic similarity, composite scoring

## üìä Optimization Strategies

### When to Use BootstrapFewShot

- ‚úÖ Tasks benefit from good examples (QA, classification, simple reasoning)
- ‚úÖ You have sufficient training data
- ‚úÖ Example quality matters more than instruction refinement

### When to Use MIPRO

- ‚úÖ Complex multi-step reasoning tasks
- ‚úÖ Creative generation tasks
- ‚úÖ Tasks where instruction clarity is crucial
- ‚úÖ You need fine-grained control over optimization stages

### Combining Strategies

- Use MIPRO for instruction optimization, then BootstrapFewShot for example selection
- Apply different strategies to different components of complex systems
- A/B test strategies to find the best approach for your specific use case

## üéõÔ∏è Interactive Features

All implementation files include:

- **Real-time Controls** - Adjust parameters and see immediate results
- **Progress Visualization** - Monitor optimization as it happens
- **Performance Analysis** - Compare different configurations and strategies
- **Export Tools** - Save results for further analysis

## üèÜ Best Practices

### Optimization Strategy

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with basic BootstrapFewShot before trying MIPRO
2. **Measure Everything** - Use comprehensive metrics to track improvements
3. **Iterate Systematically** - Test one parameter change at a time
4. **Validate Results** - Always test on held-out validation data

### Metric Design

1. **Task Alignment** - Metrics should directly measure what matters for your task
2. **Partial Credit** - Reward partially correct answers when appropriate
3. **Multi-Dimensional** - Consider accuracy, quality, style, and other factors
4. **Robust Handling** - Gracefully handle edge cases and errors

### Performance Monitoring

1. **Track Trends** - Monitor performance over multiple optimization runs
2. **Set Alerts** - Get notified when optimizations take too long or perform poorly
3. **Compare Strategies** - Systematically compare different approaches
4. **Document Findings** - Keep records of what works for different task types

## üîß Technical Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** with DSPy framework
- **API Access** to language models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Marimo** for interactive notebook experience
- **Memory**: 4GB+ RAM recommended for optimization runs
