# Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for working with DSPy and Marimo in the learning repository.

## DSPy Best Practices

### Signature Design

- Use clear, descriptive field names
- Include helpful descriptions for complex fields
- Keep signatures focused on single responsibilities

### Module Architecture

- Compose modules for reusability
- Use appropriate module types (Predict, ChainOfThought, etc.)
- Implement proper error handling

## Marimo Integration Patterns

### Reactive Design

- Design UI elements to update automatically
- Use appropriate UI components for different data types
- Implement proper state management

### Performance Optimization

- Cache expensive computations
- Use efficient data structures
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders

## Code Organization

### File Structure

- Keep related functionality together
- Use clear naming conventions
- Document complex logic
