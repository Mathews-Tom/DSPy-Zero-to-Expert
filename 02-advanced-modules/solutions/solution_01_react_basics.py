                **Observed Reasoning Patterns:**  
                1. **Logic Problems:** Agent uses deductive reasoning, applies rules systematically  
                2. **Planning Problems:** Agent breaks down into sequential steps, considers dependencies  
                3. **Analysis Problems:** Agent identifies mathematical relationships, performs calculations  

                **Strengths:**  
                - Clear step-by-step reasoning  
                - Appropriate action selection for problem type  
                - Good observation and synthesis  

                **Areas for Improvement:**  
                - Could benefit from more detailed intermediate steps  
                - Sometimes rushes to conclusions  
                - Could use more explicit verification steps

                **Strengths Identified:**  
                - **Clear Reasoning Structure:** Agent consistently follows thought ‚Üí action ‚Üí observation ‚Üí answer pattern  
                - **Problem Type Adaptation:** Different approaches for logic, planning, and analytical problems  
                - **Step-by-Step Breakdown:** Complex problems are decomposed effectively  
                - **Specific Actions:** Agent takes concrete, actionable steps rather than vague approaches  

                **Weaknesses Identified:**  
                - **Limited Verification:** Agent doesn't always double-check calculations or logic  
                - **Single-Pass Reasoning:** No iterative refinement of answers  
                - **Context Limitations:** Doesn't always maintain full context in complex problems  
                - **Error Handling:** Limited graceful handling of ambiguous or incomplete information  

                **Observed Reasoning Patterns:**  
                1. **Deductive Pattern:** For logic problems (premise ‚Üí rule ‚Üí conclusion)  
                2. **Sequential Pattern:** For planning problems (step 1 ‚Üí step 2 ‚Üí step 3)  
                3. **Analytical Pattern:** For math problems (identify formula ‚Üí calculate ‚Üí verify)  

                ### üöÄ Improvement Suggestions

                **Enhanced Signature Design:**  
                ```python
                class ImprovedReActSignature(dspy.Signature):

                **Additional Improvements:**

                    **Verification Step:**  
                    - Adds self-checking mechanism  
                    - Catches potential errors before final answer  
                    - Ensures completeness of response  

                    **Confidence Assessment:**  
                    - Provides transparency about certainty  
                    - Helps users understand reliability  
                    - Enables better decision-making  

                    **Expected Calculation:**  
                    - Growth rate: (1.5/1.0)^(1/2) - 1 = 22.47% annually  
                    - After 5 years: $1M √ó (1.2247)^5 = $2.76M
